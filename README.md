## Description

This machine learning model classifies a given poem into different ages (modern, renaissance) and types (love, nature, mythology & folklore) using logistic regression classifier.

This model is trained on [poem classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ultrajack/modern-renaissance-poetry). The accuracy of the age class is 95% while the accuracy of the type class is 65%.

This project was made over a 2-day span in September 2022.
